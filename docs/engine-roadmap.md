# Cubit Engine Roadmap

_Last updated: 2026-08-06_

A living view of what the Cubit engine has, what it still needs to be a complete
voxel engine, and the order we intend to finish it in. Gameplay (players as
entities, teams, combat, networking) is deliberately **out of scope** here — this
document is about finishing the *engine* first.

## What Cubit is today

A single-player voxel sandbox engine. You load a map, walk around under gravity with
collision, and place/break blocks. The core is complete and clean:

- **Platform / core loop:** `Application`, `Layer`/`LayerStack`, `Window`, `Input`,
  `EventBus`, `Timestep`, logging, asserts.
- **Rendering:** OpenGL context, vertex/index buffers, `VertexArray`, `Shader`,
  `Texture2D`, ortho + perspective cameras, `Renderer`, `WorldRenderer` (per-chunk
  meshes with dirty-chunk remeshing), HUD text (`DebugFont`, `HudLayer`).
- **Voxel systems:** `Block`/`Chunk`/`World` (fixed chunk grid, palette-indexed
  blocks), `ChunkMesher` (neighbour-aware, face-culled), `VoxelRaycast`,
  `VoxelCollision` (box physics), dirty-chunk tracking.
- **Content pipeline:** `VoxLoader` (load `.vox`), `VoxWriter` (save `.vox`),
  `TerrainGen` + `MapGen` (procedural map generation). See
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-25-battlefield-map-design.md`.
- **Tests:** doctest suite (`Tests/`) run as a build step.

We are roughly **two-thirds** of the way to a complete voxel engine: the skeleton is
done, but several real systems remain, mostly in rendering performance and visual
quality.

## Remaining engine systems

Ranked by leverage. Performance items are detailed in
[performance.md](performance.md).

### Performance / scale
1. ~~**Threaded / amortized meshing**~~ **DONE 2026-07-25** — `WorldRenderer::Update`
   meshes at most a per-frame budget of chunks instead of the whole world at load.
   True threading remains deferred.
2. ~~**Frustum culling**~~ **DONE 2026-07-25** — `WorldRenderer::Render` tests each
   chunk's world-space AABB against the camera frustum before submitting.
3. ~~**Greedy meshing**~~ **TRIED AND REJECTED 2026-08-06** — built, measured, and
   reverted. It cut geometry 20.7% but doubled meshing time in both Debug and
   Release, and draw calls are one per chunk either way, so the geometry saved
   never reached the frame time that would have to pay for it. Full numbers and
   reasoning in [performance.md](performance.md) P3.

### Visual quality
4. ~~**Lighting / ambient occlusion**~~ **DONE 2026-07-26** — per-vertex corner AO
   plus sky light propagated through the world (`SkyLight::PropagateAll`/
   `Repropagate`) replace the old fixed per-face shading constants.
5. ~~**Transparency / alpha blending**~~ **DONE 2026-08-06** — palette alpha marks
   a block non-opaque; the mesher splits chunk geometry and the renderer draws the
   transparent set back to front with depth writes off. Water is see-through and
   its bed is lit. Water is still *solid* — collision and raycast are Phase 2.

### Format / smaller gaps
6. **Multi-model stitching** — load maps larger than 256³ (true Ace-of-Spades
   512×512 scale needs several stitched `.vox` models).
7. ~~**World persistence**~~ **DONE 2026-07-31** — `ToVoxModel` plus
   `VoxWriter::WriteFile` write an edited world back to `.vox`; the Sandbox binds
   it to `F5`.
8. **Camera aim API** — `PerspectiveCameraController` exposes only `SetPosition`, no
   yaw/pitch setter, so a spawn cannot choose its facing.

### Likely non-goals (given the flat-colour, fixed-map aesthetic)
- Per-block **textures** (blocks are palette colours by design).
- **LOD / streaming** (maps are a fixed known size — this is why `World` is a fixed
  grid).
- **Audio** (belongs with gameplay, not the core engine).

## The "finish the engine" arc

A bounded sequence — genuinely finishable, not endless:

1. ~~**Amortized meshing + frustum culling**~~ **DONE 2026-07-25** — the map now
   ships at 256×64×256 and loads without a stall. Threading still deferred.
2. ~~**Ambient-occlusion lighting**~~ **DONE 2026-07-26** (the visual leap).
3. ~~**Transparency**~~ **DONE 2026-08-06** (opacity; solidity is Phase 2).
4. ~~**Greedy meshing**~~ **TRIED AND REJECTED 2026-08-06** — see P3.
5. **Multi-model stitching** (full AoS-scale maps). ← next

After these, the engine is "done" for our purposes, and the remaining work is all
gameplay.

**What the greedy-meshing attempt taught us.** The ordering note above said AO
should land before greedy meshing, so the merge criterion could be written
AO-aware from the start. That was right as far as it went, but it understated the
consequence: requiring matching AO *and* light does not merely complicate the
merge criterion, it removes most of the opportunity. Per-vertex shading and greedy
meshing are close to mutually exclusive on lit outdoor terrain — the faces worth
merging are the ones a shading gradient disqualifies.

Worth remembering before adopting another technique whose headline figure comes
from engines with flat-shaded faces.
